# benchmark

> Tricky and fun utilities for Go programs on macOS.

## Goals

-   Create automated benchmark tests for Go programs
-   -   without generics, the tricky part is making the features good for general use
-   Create a 'faker' that generates random input data
-   Create a 'generator' that reads all go files from a repository and generates benchmarks
